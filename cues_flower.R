#Linear Mixed Effect Regression
#Individual plants at the same site are likely to behave similarly - site should probably be a random effect
#Plants are probably responding to multiple climatic conditions, daylength, and these responses may differ
#by latitude based on local adaptation or other factors.

#Ok, so to interpret this, am I looking for the model with the lowest criterion? Which is model 1
#So, I should rescale some variables
#And, then maybe it would be easier to get the effects, like spring min temps advance/delay by X days, the interaction
#effect is like: after accounting for latitude, spring temps delay bloom by X days?
