# TimeToRestore

Time to Restore is a SC Climate Adaptation Science Center-funded project aimed at better understanding
how the plants that pollinators depend on are responding to climate change. Project results 
will ultimately help shape species selection for restoration. For more information see www.usanpn.org/TimetoRestore

For the first phase of the effort (ending Sept 2023), we will deliver StoryMaps and Information Sheets
with calendars showing multiple species' bloom and seed periods (heatmap_calendars.R), peak bloom periods 
(peak_phenometrics_flower.R), and preliminary analysis of climate and environmental cues for bloom
(cues_flower.R).
